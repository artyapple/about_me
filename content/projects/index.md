## Design the Smart Mobility â€“ ITS Hackathon Hamburg

The following hackathon was organized by Deutsche Bahn (the national railway company of Germany). During this time, Telegram messenger was rapidly growing and introduced a convenient API for chat bots. As a result we decided to develop a companion bot for DB customers. Routing was implemented by integration with DB-API. Afterwards, we implemented additional functionality such as break and incident notifications on DB trains, and a couple of entertainment features.

## Mobility Hackathon 2017

The first hackathon i participated in was organized by Hamburg public transport company (HVV). Our team tried to make a prototype for underground navigating without Internet connection. We used Bluetooth beacons for spatial orientation and presented an easy to use app for interaction with the users.
