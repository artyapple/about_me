## Design the Smart Mobility â€“ ITS Hackathon Hamburg

The following hackathon was organized by Deutsche Bahn (the national railway company of Germany). During this time, Telegram messenger was rapidly growing and introduced a convenient API for chat bots. As a result we decided to develop a companion bot for DB customers. Routing was implemented by integration with DB-API. Afterwards, we implemented additional functionality such as break and incident notifications on DB trains, and a couple of entertainment features.
