## University

I graduated from the [University of Applied Science Hamburg](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/en/) with a bachelor degree in computer science in 2019. I consider myself lucky to join Prof. Becke’s group of students who specialized in distributed systems. Under Professor Becke guidance, I wrote my graduate thesis on “Analysis of a blockchain-based IoT infrastructure with Ethereum and Swarm”.

During the study, the IoT devices were configured as blockchain nodes and integrated into a common private Ethereum network. In the respective architectures, a Swarm Peer-to-Peer network was used as the data storage and Smart Contract was provided to enable interaction with the blockchain. The system was exposed to a linearly increasing data load within 36 hours.
