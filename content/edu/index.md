## University

![regular](images/uni.png)

In 2019, I graduated from the [University of Applied Science Hamburg](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/en/) with a degree in computer science. I was lucky enough to join Prof. Becke's group of students who specialized in distributed systems. Under Professor Becke guidance, I completed my graduate thesis on "Analysis of a blockchain-based IoT infrastructure with Ethereum and Swarm".

During the study, the IoT devices were configured as blockchain nodes and integrated into a common private Ethereum network. In the respective architectures, a Swarm Peer-to-Peer network was used as the data storage and Smart Contract was provided to enable interaction with the blockchain. The system was exposed to a linearly increasing data load within 36 hours.

The final thesis can be found [here](https://reposit.haw-hamburg.de/handle/20.500.12738/9127).
