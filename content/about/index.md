![about](images/art_about.jpg)
I am a software developer with 8 years of development experience in payment services and energy monitoring systems. My curiosity and passion for information technologies drives me to learn new and try it outside of work hours. Iâ€™m looking forward to continued involvement in projects with ambitions, wide tech stacks, and a friendly team.
