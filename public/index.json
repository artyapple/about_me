In the respective architectures, a Swarm Peer-to-Peer network was used as the data storage and Smart Contract was provided to enable interaction with the blockchain. The system was exposed to a linearly increasing data load within 36 hours.\nThe final thesis can be found here.\nCertificates \u0026amp; Courses React Native - The Practical Guide Udemy, 2022 ID: UC-3d1f5088-e87b-4102-8e59-b39df95a5a84\nISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level iSQI Group, 2017ID: 17-CTFL-118242-01\n","permalink":"/edu/","summary":"University In 2019, I graduated from the University of Applied Science Hamburg with a degree in computer science.

There we came in as an experienced team and gave away one of the best projects. We have created an app for planning day trips around Hamburg using public transportation. Unfortunately the repository is private, but you can see the presentation below.\npresentation\nDesign the Smart Mobility – ITS Hackathon Hamburg This hackathon was organized by Deutsche Bahn (the national railway company of Germany). At that time, the messenger Telegram was rapidly gaining an audience and around the same time introduced a convenient api for chat bots. For ITS hackathon, we decided to implement a companion bot. First of all, routing was implemented through integration with db-api. After that, we implemented various additional functionality, such as notification service about breaks or incidents on the train through the same bot, and a couple of entertainment functions.\nGitHub\nMobility Hackathon 2017 My first hackathon, was organized by Hamburg public transport company (HVV). Our team tried to make a prototype for underground navigating without the Internet connection. We used bluetooth beacons for spatial orientation and implemented an simple app for interaction with the user.\nGitHub\n","permalink":"/other/","summary":"Mobility Hackathon 2018 One of the last hackathons so far.
