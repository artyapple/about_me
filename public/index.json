During this time, Telegram messenger was rapidly growing and introduced a convenient API for chat bots. As a result we decided to develop a companion bot for DB customers. Routing was implemented by integration with DB-API. Afterwards, we implemented additional functionality such as break and incident notifications on DB trains, and a couple of entertainment features.\nGitHub\nMobility Hackathon 2017 The first hackathon i participated in was organized by Hamburg public transport company (HVV).
